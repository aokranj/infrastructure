# How to create a new admin user



## Admins

Things to do when adding a new admin:
- System user: Define the new admin in the [users/admins.yml](../users/admins.yml) playbook
- MariaDB user: Add a [MySQL/MariaDB user](../db/admins.yml) for this admin 
- Add them to our GitHub organization
- Add them to "masters" team in our GitHub org
- (TODO SSO for tools.dev.aokranj.com?)
